# How to Fix Firebase Admin "Could not load the default credentials" Error

The error occurs because the server (your local machine or Vercel) doesn't have the permission to send notifications or access the database as an Admin. You need a **Service Account Key**.

## Step 1: Generate the Key
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Select your project (`emesispro`).
3. Click the ⚙️ (Gear icon) -> **Project Settings**.
4. Go to the **Service accounts** tab.
5. Click **Generate new private key**.
6. Confirm by clicking **Generate key**. This will download a JSON file.

## Step 2: Install the Key (Choose Option A or B)

### Option A: Local Development (Easiest for localhost)
1. Rename the downloaded file to `serviceAccountKey.json`.
2. Move it to the **root folder** of this project (same level as `package.json`).
   - *Note: This file is already in `.gitignore`, so it won't be pushed to GitHub.*

### Option B: Using Environment Variables (Best for Vercel/Production)
1. Open the downloaded JSON file and copy its entire content.
2. In your `.env.local` file (create it if missing), add:
   ```env
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='PASTE_THE_ENTIRE_JSON_CONTENT_HERE'
   ```
   *(Make sure it's all on one line or properly quoted)*.

3. **If deploying to Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel Project Settings -> Environment Variables.
   - Add `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` with the JSON content as the value.

## Step 3: Restart Server
Stop your local server (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again. The error should be gone.
